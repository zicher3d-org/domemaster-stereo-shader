Mac OS X Installation Notes
--------------------------------

If you are running Mac OS X 10.8 or 10.9 you need to open your System Preferences and adjust the Security & Privacy settings to allow apps downloaded from "Anywhere" to run.

This will allow the unsigned Domemaster3D installer to copy the lens shader library into the Mental Ray shaders folder, and create the /Applications/Domemaster3D resource folder.
